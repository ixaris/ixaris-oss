# Asynchronous Helpers

This is a set of helpers for writing and transforming Java asynchronous code

- [`ixaris-commons-async-lib`](lib/README.md) is the main library (you probably want to start from here)
- [`ixaris-commons-async-transformer`](transformer/README.md) is the transformer tied to the library
- [`ixaris-commons-async-test`](test/README.md) provides helpers for testing asynchronous code
- [`ixaris-commons-async-reactive`](reactive/README.md) provides helpers around reactive streams
- `ixaris-commons-async-javac-transformed` and `ixaris-commons-async-eclipse-transformed` are transformer tests. You only want to go there if you're contributing to the transformer
